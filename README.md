## :warning: **NOTIFICATION: Repository Deprecation**

**"CMS JS Building Blocks" is becoming "CMS React"!**

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our software and services, this repository is being deprecated. We are transitioning to a [new repository](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react) to provide you with better updates, more features, and a more streamlined experience.

## What This Means for You

- **No New Updates**: This repository will no longer receive updates or bug fixes.
- **Migration**: Users are encouraged to migrate to the [new repository](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react) to continue receiving the latest features and updates.
- **Support**: Limited support will be available for this repository until 04.01.24, after which it will be archived.

## Why the migration?

As the feature set and usage of "CMS React" (formerly "CMS JS Building Blocks") grows we want to integrate it more tightly with our larger development platform. This [new repository](https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-react) will contain all the examples and docs found here, and additionally will feature our default modules built with CMS React.

We appreciate your support and understanding as we make these changes to serve you better. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us over in our slack channel [\#cms-js-rendering](https://hubspotdev.slack.com/archives/C04AY1H2204) or by opening an issue where.

Thank you for being part of our community.
